# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    the most diffcult part of tiktactoe to me was creating the has_won function. I struggled to find out how to write all the possible win conditions and needed assisstance from group mates.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    I would try to import a math.random package for the computer to move.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    If the computer goes first, they would always go center and then a corner space.
